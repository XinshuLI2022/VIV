This is the official implemetation of [Distribution-Conditioned Adversarial Variational Autoencoder for Valid Instrumental Variable Generation ](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/29271).

The codes for data generation and evaluation is built on the basis of [Deep IV: A Flexible Approach for Counterfactual Prediction ](https://github.com/jhartford/DeepIV) and [Learning Instrumental Variable from Data Fusion for Treatment Effect Estimation ](https://github.com/causal-machine-learning-lab/meta-em)
